"To the person who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don't feel so. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",1

"Great videos! You've made it easy to learn Python, especially coming from a background in C. I do have a quick question: towards the beginning of the video, you say that the string 'Python' has 7 characters. Does this include a null character, or was this simply a mistake? Thank you! :)",1
"Great video ! I love the way you explain evereything, it all makes sense. Keep up the great vídeos ! I have a small feedback, I know that every video you teach us a new tool of programing that opens up a whole new universe of small projects that we can do to get better, and at the end of the video you give us a smal project ""homework"" but its always very oriented in training that specific tool, i think that at the end of every video you should give us 3 small but yet challenging projects that we will use everything that we learned until that point. Thank you so much for the awesome content, and i hope you understand what im saying.. im sorry for the bad english.. Much love from Brasil !!  🇧🇷👍",1

"Thanks for your tutorials!! This is how I did it.. Can you tell me how I can make this look better? Is there anyway I can make it look attractive? Just for fun though.

"Well, I must say I was surprised how well - Because I finally understand quite a bit more - about FUNTIONS. You explain, you give examples, you use lines, arrows, to show how the programs works... and that is VERY VALUABLE to me. I haven't tried the assignment yet... but I assume you will explain it in detail so we'll know if we did it right or how to fix our knowledge, and if this assumption is correct, then you can NOT to help but SUCCEED. We'll see.",1
Thank You so much Sir. Your work means a lot to beginner like us!!,1

This has been very helpful. Thankyou .,1
Thanks a lot for your effort! Great tutorial!,1
"Not sure if it is already discussed or not. At 3:37:00 you updated the model by running the same cell for multiple epochs. There the previous model got updated and thus accuracy improved. Not that, with less epoch the accuracy is high. Thanks :)",1
Thank you so much for your work and dedication!,1
Thank you Tim,1
"For people wanting to understand the basic idea behind Neural Networks, 3BlueOneBrown's video is a nice addition to your introduction! It helped me understand the topics and coding Tim discussed a lot better",1
This is gold! Thank you so much,1
Congrats for your video!,1

Thanks foryour support!,1
Best ML course,1
Great tutorial on AI/ML.,1
This video is a rare gem!!! Thanks alot for these courses!!,1
tensorflow-rocm is a thing that (sort of) works now. FYI,1
"Just finished the tutorial, it's really well made and an amazing intro to ML concepts. I'm really excited to explore this further thankyou so much Tim.",1
"For anyone who failed to install TensorFlow -> TensorFlow still has no support for 3.8.*, so download and install python 3.7.9 (Don't add to PATH!) and run ""pip install virtualenv"". Then restart your pycharm and create a new project. Choose ""virtual environment"" option instead of ""python interpreter"" and choose python 3.7 from the dropdown menu. Good luck.",1
Learning is something different than openionizing. Tim you are such a good teacher man.,1
excellent,1
Just started. Know nothing so can’t contribute yet but wanted to thank you for advancing humanity. You may have just given my life a purpose,1
subtitle would be great,1
Wonderful.  Great Thank you.,1
"This guys is a real droid: not only he had a serif pic, he also kept teaching us non stop for 7 hrs with out even a flinch , he also taught me how to use Google's notebook (feels like I'm the agent in Google's environment sometimes)Thank you and do more of these please",1
This is one of the best tutorials ever.. Thank you so much for your hard work on this..  😍😍😍 I love the documents and the video explanation alot.. Many thanks to you.. Keep uploading more stuff on machine learning,1
what a course done by you tim  really thats off to you and your dedication towards teaching thanks a lot,1
Awesome video! Anyone knows how to set up the same autocompletion?,1
Awesome!!,1
"This video is a must-watch for beginners getting into machine learning. I wish I had seen this video before. I have never got a better understanding of these topics and the differences between the terms AI, Machine Learning, etc. Thank you, sir, for your efforts.I am in class 12, and there is Linear Regression in Mathematics, but I haven't even thought that it can be used in ML also.",1
"It's ""Environment"", but you are a god. I never thought I'd actually watch a 6 hours long video. Now my school's AI Teacher fears me. Thank you.",1
"This is great Video. I'm a beginner -its kind of laid the path to my datascience learning. Thankyou so much for putting this together.  I have a question, in dftain dataframe - column n_siblings_spouses,	parch is numeric column but wondering why do you have to add it to categorical column.",1
"great course, thanks for sharing Tim",1
fking god,1
Thank you so much for this!,1
May you live long and prosper.  Such wealth of information given for free...kudos on your effort and your contribution to mankind,1
He may not be the greatest teacher tbh (but he is included to those who are great) but his commitment to teaching is undeniable! Thank you sir.,1
This is amazing thank you so much!!!!!!!!,1
"Wow, codecamp and tim in the same video! Great job, guys. Thanks for all the classes!",1

Thank you !!!,1
1.25x will save some time,1
Actually Enjoyable,1
You are a great teacher,1
Having the TF documentation and tutorial pages in video format is pretty helpful. Thanks!,1
You rock bro <3,1
Very nice content,1
Thumbs Up! What A Clear Explanation and also By The Way You Cared Of Other People Having A Crapy and old school computer by using google colaboratory just loved this and recommend to all the people who want to hop into this field. tim made it vert-very easy for beginners and intermediate programmers to understand tensorflow by heart. Thumbs Up!!,1
Thanks a lot for making it on youtube.😍👌👍,1
"Well done Tim, thank you.",1
"Hey man, just wanted to say you make the internet awesome, thanks",1
Thank you brother! Amazing work,1
I thought your notebooks were very well organized and a lot more comprehensible than tensorflow documentation. I mostly used the notebooks when writing/understanding code but the video was good especially for explaining concepts. Definitely just surface level but  before this I knew nothing on ML. I feel like a learned a lot. Thanks man.,1
You are the best bro thanks 👍,1
great course!,1
After watching this video i can't stop myself from liking this video. this is really very informative and useful. Thanks.,1
"Guys This is Important, So if you get an error like this while installing tensorflow using pip :Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement TensorFlow (from versions: )No matching distribution found for TensorFlow.It is because you have 32-bit python is installed. Just uninstall it and install 64 bit. Tensorflow only supports the 64-bit version of python. I struggled with this issue for almost 2 months. So, I thought to comment on it.  Happy coding peeps  : )",1
Great Job. Thank you very much for your effort!,1
"This tutorial was absolutely incredible, thank you so much :)",1
That's really great master,1
What a talented young pack of surprise..you are a very good teacher,1
Thank you for this video. This is the most thorough and simple introduction to Tensorflow and AI in general.,1
Really excellent tutorial. The explanations are great and the material was very well put together. Thanks so much Tim. So many many great helper functions.,1
"Bro, your work is really awesome, please DO NOT STOP.",1
Very good course!,1
"Great,  thanks for your time 🙏",1
"Great Video Tutorial. Learned a lot about Tensorflow 2.0. Your GC notebooks were very informative and the way you explained every topic was great. Hoping for more such videos about ML,AI and deep learning.",1
found it quite helpful thank you,1
Nice work and great course Tim Edit: Me literally dancing just because I got better accuracy at 1:46:47 XD,1
"Great Tutorial! Just a heads up, there was a mistake at 3:35:00 - you forgot to reinitialize the ""model""!",1
Great Work Tim! Providing so much content for Free is so very kind of you!!,1
Just completed module 3 and now things are more clear to me .. thank you so much  🙏🏼,1
People like you are gods to us plebs.,1

"Thanks a lot, this was very informative. Gave you a little tip with my hard earned BAT, haha",1
Thank you !,1
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Great work explaining everything in detail.,1
"A huge thanks for not including any Ads, which often drift us away from the agenda. Also your teaching methodology is exceptionally good.This video is exactly what I was looking for. A huge thanks to freeCodeCamp and Tim for making my day and most of us, I guess.",1
Thank you a lot!,1
The best machine learning course on YT.🙌 Love it,1
"Just wanna thank you Tim and FreecodeCamp for these kind of amazing acts! ""Give a man a fish and you feed him for the day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for life!"" lol or something like that and thats exactly what you guys are doing for people like me",1
Great work mate.,1
Tim is really an awesome teacher.Thanks dude:),1
"Thank you for your tutorial. I want to ask, if i want to use a model that was created on Google Colab to be used as a GUI, how do I do it ?",1
"Venke Vinj Tim, this is a good one. I picked up a thing or two. Keep it flowing :)",1
I'm two hours in and I have to say you did a really great job with this. I don't really post YouTube comments but this is awesome.,1
Thanks we waiting for Keras,1
this is great! until they decide to change everything on us again...,1
"Thank you for all your efforts Tim - I have been programming for about 25 years but only in VBA/SQL for Excel and Access, so very much traditional CRM/Back Office functionality etc and a little bit of ASP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the the web - so no actual Python Experience and completely new to Colab/Jupyter  notebooks, Google Drive and of course ML/TensorFlow, but I was able to follow your course over a few days and nipped off here and there to learn the some basics of Python/Numpy/Pandas/MatPlotLib etc  just so i could keep up and understand your code a bit more. I thought your course was excellent a perfect mix of hand holding giving a great overview and good level of detail in the right places.I've no idea how long it took you to create it - but it took me three long days to watch it, back-up re-watch etc but I truly got a huge amount of value from it so a BIG THANK-YOU and I highly recommend it as a very informative starting point for anyone new to ML.  I didn't realise there were so many different types of ML but this course has certainly clarified the areas of ML that I am interested in and i'm much clearer on the path where I need to focus going forward - Five Gold Stars for content! Eleven out of Ten for effort!!",1
Very beautiful explanation. Easy to understand. Recommended for beginners.,1
You rule Tim! Best 7 hours invested in quarantine!,1

"Thanks Tim, we appreciate you taking time to make such a nice tutorial for us. I'll come back after I watched the whole tutorial. \m/",1
"God will bless you bro  for presenting such a wonderful course.  Although they are certain mistake that was made along the line, Like the regression, classification and so forth. No one is perfect, I guess I have learnt a lot her, what next from here i guess is to lay my hand on some challenging projects.",1
"How can people dislike this ?  That's clear code, clear explainations and a lot of work, thanks you !",1
nice green eyes,1

You are the best TOEFL teacher I found so far !!!",1

Hey josh! I took my TOEFL exam the other week and I am really disappointed when I got my speaking score. I got 25 but the specific score that is required for us is 26. I did great in other areas though. I am going to take it again next week. I am practicing & watching your videos again. I hope I can score 26+ on speaking. 🤞🏼🙏🏼,1
Really helpful sir.Thanks a lot.,1
This is the first video that I saw and liked it¡¡¡ thanks for the information,1
"Hi, Great tips!  I am facing these two challenges: Firstly, I often end up using long sentences and use too many words to describe anything. Secondly, I often tend to re-structure my sentences if I find myself unable to complete it and therefore I end up explaining the same thing in a structurally different manner and this takes up a lot of time.  Any tips on how I can overcome these two problems. Thanks :)",1
"Hi Josh,  I just wanna say THANK YOU for sharing your knowledge and helping so many people with your videos!! I just got my scores, 113!! (R 29, L 29, S 29, W 26).

A lot of people need teacher like you :)",1
"If you would apply all the pieces of advice for the toefl to your videos, this video could be 5 minutes long and much better for everybody.",1
very useful thanks,1
"Thank you so much, Josh. It's so valuable. Uph agree about casual speech problem. I start to analyze when I think before speaking. It's when you're afraid to use casual phrases or slang words you've picked up from TV or books in your response and you start to slow down. That's a real one problem to be stuck with inventing something ahah while recording. So hard to get rid of it. I mean maybe it's fine in real life, but you got to stay formal but not too much at the same time somehow:)",1
Thanks for the clear TOEFL speaking prep.,1
"Hey Josh, I'm taking the TOEFL on Tuesday and have been watching your content during all my preparation. I would like to thank you for all your high quality videos and good advices, just carry on this way you are an excellent teacher :)",1

"Oh my god... Josh. How are you doing?? You look great. I was a student called Ji Won Jung who you had taught at ASA college 5years ago.  I am not sure that you remeber me.  So i changed my profile image for helping remind you.  I just was fiding some English videos to study with keyword “repeat sentences”. And click a video randomly.  Then you appeared!  Anyway, i am happy to see you again. You are really a repected teacher.  Take care away Corona19.",1
Your videos are making me feel relax. So thank you and appreciate it. I will let you know my score after 4th April hopefully,1

I just want to say THANK YOU! 😄 Just by having solid(good, but not perfect) knowledge of English and watching this videos on Youtube in order to prepare, YOU WILL get the score you want.",1
"I watched your videos and used your templates. I honestly thought i failed speaking again because in my head i messed up the last question. I literally just saw my score and i got 29 in speaking, i am so happy. My 1st attempt was 23. Also your listening video about closing your eyes while listening works like magic, got 29 there too. Thank you so much. Now i can write my board exams. You are definitely an excellent teacher.",1

"Josh, I am so delighted to share my TOEFL Scores that I received today-  113/120 with 29/30 on SPEAKING!!! I have been preparing for the GMAT during this entire year so Reading and Writing were taken care of, but I needed to practice Speaking. In the past during my high school and early college years, I struggled to speak at a stretch apart from informal conversations and I'd freeze during presentations and speeches.  Usually I can express myself better through writing, texts, emails etc. I only prepared for about 2 days for the TOEFL and found this video and the website to improve my speaking skills for the respective tasks. And plus I didn't even know of the new format as I took the TOEFL 6 years ago and scored just a 95. Thank you so much! Ever grateful.",1
"Josh, I wish I could comment on all of your videos you make to help students! Your videos are simply AMAZING. The video that you made on Speaking section of the TOEFL was so much helpful that I can't express my gratitude in words. The Tips and the Starts of the TOEFL speaking given were just amazing Josh.

I got 29 - Reading, 28 - Listening, 30 - Speaking and 27 - Writing. Thanks TST Prep team!",1

Thanks for all the videos sir . Got 114/120 R27 L30 S28 W29 . Your content really improvised my skills. 😇,1
"Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I watched your YouTube videos while studying for the TOEFL exam, and I found them so incredibly helpful. I just got my score and was happy with it, and I wanted to say thank you for the help that you provided☺️",1
Thanks for a video with wonderful tips! I’m just curious whether I really have to say that much for 45seconds? I usually thought 6sentences are enough unless each one is too short.,1
"Hello Josh, I took my TOEFL last Saturday and got my scores today. I got a 110 - 30R, 28L, 25S, 27W! My goal was 100. Many thanks to you! Your videos have helped me a lot.",1
"Many thanks for your advices and templates, it helps me a lot to organize my answers !",1
"Hii Josh. Thanks a ton for being a wonderful TOEFL teacher. I just got my score, Speaking 30, Listening 30, Writing 26 and Reading 25(Total 111). I followed your advice, used  your templates for the exam and it all worked out very well. I listened to all your videos,they help a lot in organizing thoughts and be able to speak confidently  during the exam. Stay the way you are i.e. AWESOME. The way you speak and explain is very soothing. During the exam I was a bit panic stricken then I recalled how you said ""TOEFL Speaking is weird"" and I composed myself and gave the exam and aced it. I appreciate your sincere efforts, thank you !",1
"I like the steps you mentioned, its really helpful. Thanks",1
OMG Thank you so much! This is help me a lot.,1
Based off of this i now see that my biggest struggle with the TOEFL test will not be my English comprehension but rather my inability to structure my thoughts... great 🤣🙃,1
"This dude is really helpful, for real!=D",1
Amazing videos! Thanks for the templates that you provided,1
"THIS CHANNEL IS IT GUYS!! Hey Josh, I took my TOEFL a week ago and got a 30 on the speaking section. I started my preparation (a few days before the exam) and ended it going over your videos and they helped me more than anything out there. You're an amazing teacher, thanks a lot!!!!",1
This is exactly what I’d been looking for! I love how you talk patiently:),1
Thanks you so much josh your tips will help me a lot,1
"You are the best youtube channel in the worldddddddd! it can be seen that you put your heart in every tutorial, and i have been learning a lot. I hope all people invest in your company because you offer and fisrt-class quality product. Thanks for your social help. We realy apreciate it",1
"Josh, thank you very much for your videos! I scored 100 (R:25 L:23 S:25 W:27). My minimum was 95 and I got such an amazing result thanks to your videos. 🙏🙏🙏",1
Oh my goodness! this video is what I was looking for. Mr. Josh M. Thank you!,1
"Thank you for distributing all these information! I tried to figure out by myself, but I'm not sure, so I would like to ask you. I'm not a very decision-friendly person in general and it often happens to me, that I like both sides or need more time than ""normal humans"" to decide for one. I often read in the TOEFL Guide that ""there is no right and wrong"", but then again - you must answer. Is it  a problem, when I do agree with two opposites and explain pros and cons in order to explain, why it is hard for me to decide? Concerning Speaking and Writing questions. Thanks in advance!",1
"Hi Josh, this comment might be very similar to some comments here but I just wanted to express my gratitude. I watched your videos just one week before the test. They did boost my confidence a lot. Eventually, I got 117 (with 28 on Speaking, which I had only got 20 in the previous time). Thank you so much!P/S: in my opinion, the most special things in your videos are your jokes and laughs. We all know that preparing for a test is very stressful but your teaching style helped me get over most of the unnecessary stress while still gain the crucial knowledge. Once again, thank you!",1
"Hi there, I am looking for an English speaking partner to improve my English",1
I can't say how much good this video👍👍😇😎,1
"Thank you Josh!!! Watched and practised in a couple of videos from other channels, I come back to your channel to learn from you of the answers /structures / template. Thank You for being so generous to share your wisdom and helping us!!! It is very nice of you! You are really a very good teacher, watching  your lectures is like talking to my close friends!!!",1
"Hi Joseph, I just got back my results. I got 100! R: 27 L:24  S:25  W:24. Your videos helped me a lot, I really want to thank you because without these free resources I probably wouldn't have scored as high (even though I know I can do better with more time to practice. In my defense, I work a full-time job and only had 1 month to prepare. For anyone who's going through something similar, I suggest you to start with Speaking practice and make a realistic schedule to practice every day a little bit (and try to dedicate more time on weekends to go through full practice tests).",1
"This is by far the best tutorial I have ever watched on Youtube ! Hats off to you, Josh! This whole process of doing this test was broken down perfectly!",1
"Hi Josh, I watched your videos a few weeks before the exam and they were extremely helpful, I got C1 level in TOEFL even in speaking and listening that were my weakest skills but with your help I could accomplish my goal. Huge thanks to you. Now I am an English teacher and I'm gonna share these videos with my students.",1
"Thanks Josh, I watched your videos  and  took  your writing course (R:21, L:23, S:27, W:22).",1

Thank you so much! This was really helpful!! :),1
"Hey Josh, thank you very much for your videos! I would appreciate if you could give me advice, considering that i did my TOEFL prep test. I’ve got 23 on speaking and the main argument for  not getting more points was “the lack of details”. Delivery, language and topic development were good in all parts od speaking , but ,,missing details” were prob in all parts as well. Any advice for improving this particular issue would be very useful, my exam is in 5 days :)) thanks in advance!",1
"Hi Josh! I just wanna let you, and everyone, know that I studied for the TOEFL using your super amazing videos, and I was able to achieve an amazing score!! For the Speaking, which was the part that I feared the most, I was able to improve my score from 22 (from last year) to 29!! I'm super excited!! Thank you so so so much, and keep up your amazing job at helping so many people!",1
"Hi Josh! Thanks for such a useful video! I always make a mistake with grammar every time I speak and trying to correct them during my speaking. Thus, I can't ever complete my speaking. Could you please give me some methods to practice and solve this common issue? I appreciate your reply, anyways.",1
"Hey Josh, I found your videos quite helpful and followed the templates suggested by tst prep. I took my TOEFL on Dec 21, I got 114.",1
Hi Josh! Just thought I should reach out and thank you for your help. I scored 112 a few days ago and trust me your videos were a huge help in getting that proverbial cherry on the cake. So thank you so much! Love the way you make these videos. Keep up the great work and all the best! Much appreciated.,1

It's simply how my brain likes to operate. These videos helped me improve it, even though I found them a few days before the exam. You're a great teacher, thanks!!!",1

I wanna preparing Toefl test by myself. Thank you for your videos. It's helpfully and I waiting for next video.I'm watching from Thailand.,1
Your videos are really good. I have seen many videos on toefl. But nobody has explained in the way that you have. Most importantly you just appear on the screen as a teacher. Thank you with your suggestions. I've my toefl on the day after tomorrow. But your premiere on #3 in 5days..it is really sad for me. Thank you josh again.,1
"Thank you for your video, I was trying really hard to get 2 reasons and 2 examples in my practice of the speaking questions #1, but I just can't. My mind stops working after my first reason and it stresses me out. You're the first one I ear saying we can respond by only one reason. It will help me a lot. It's easier for me to extrapolate one reason with a longer exemple. There's less pauses and it's less robotic.",1
Thanks for the advices man !!,1

Thank you very much...,1

You are the best in the Profession Mosh. Clarity on LinkedList.,1
"Mosh, I have bought this course on your website and let me just say - the way you teach how to create our own methods to manipulate arrays is exactly how my d.s. & a. class in school should have taught us but didn't! We are essentially learning how the original Java classes were developed from scratch with your course! SO COOL",1
"I'm only about a half-hour into this lesson, and I can already tell that it will be very helpful. I was trying to follow along with an eight-hour video posted by a Google engineer and was really struggling. Your approach to teaching this concept is working much better for me. Thank you for posting this video!",1
This was really helpful thx!,1
Best one!,1

It's a strange matter in me that I am never satisfied by just good explanation, I also need to have nice presentations too! Just like the one you are having. Your videos are the just perfect blueprint of the kind of educational videos I always wanted to watch...once again, thanks mosh. You really get my back everytime I need to have such nice explanations of any topic!!❤️",1

"Very interesting Mosh! The building an array exercise, we had some quite different solutions! Mine was: package com.jordan;  import java.util.Arrays;  public class Array {     private int[] items;      public Array( int length) {         items = new int[length];     }      public void insert(int item){         int[] temp_item = new int[items.length + 1];          for ( int i = 0; i < items.length; i++){             temp_item[i] = items[i];         }         temp_item[items.length] = item;          items = temp_item;     }      public void removeAt(int index){         int[] temp_item = new int[items.length - 1];          int count = 0;         for ( int i = 0; i < items.length; i++ ){             if (i != index) {                 temp_item[count] = items[i];                 count++;             }         }          items = temp_item;     }      public int indexOf(int index){         try {             return items[index];         } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException arrayIndexOutOfBoundsException){             return -1;         }     }      public void print(){         System.out.println(Arrays.toString(items));     } }",1

"Mosh, you're an amazing tutor! YouTube suggested me your design patterns lesson and from that moment I can't stop watching your videos. I'm also going to buy the whole courses from your website. I would like to point out a correction (or rather an omission) on this video though. Although you correctly pointed out that the time complexity of removing the last item from a linked list is O(n), for the Java LinkedList is actually O(1) since it's implemented as a double linked-list. Again, thank you for your awesome work!",1
Thanks Mosh this is just what I needed to level up as a developer right now <3,1
"Great video! For the removeAt() method for Array, I believe if you have an Array on length 1 and one element within it, passing 0 as the index will cause an array index out of bounds exception.",1
You aren't just an amazing man you are wonderful with the meaning of the word. A lot of thanks to you. Every single word is useful than you imagine,1
The quality of the video is amazing. Keep it up!,1

You sure do have a code charming smile,1
the best  video I have ever seen about the basics. Easy to understand and detailed! good luck,1
"Hey Mosh, great video first of all, im a sophomore in college at the moment, i know HTML, CSS and JavaScript, would that be enough for starters so i can start front-end development? I'm in this field for about a year so i'm still kind of new, any help is appreciated, thanks",1
Probably best to learn soft skills too.. Everyone seems to focus on the technical and ignoring soft skills,1
Thanks for this video.Please make a video on Back-end,1

watching this video made me want to subscribe.,1

Hey Mosh nice video again.,1
"To the person reading this, you are precious and valuable even if you don't feel like it. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care!",1
"Good day sir. Sending this comment from Nigeria 🇳🇬, I've followed the step mentioned in this video and I've studied the each topics on the HTML and CSS from W3School but the problem is how to apply it in real life projects but I would try to see what I can create with the knowledge acquired and I don't know if I can be sending my projects to you time to time so you can review it for me and correct my lapses God bless❤",1

I have the certificates but feel clueless right now I didn’t expect to need to use my new skills so soon I was planning a career change for later.

"I love doing these follow along projects. I cant learn from just reading text, I am a visual learner.",1
"I am using a book to learn and get used to all the syntax and logical thinking. Then, I will come to free code camp to work on these projects. I hope to not just copy and paste code but be able to understand and do them in my own way, refer to this great programmer and see her approach when I get stuck. I used to program long ago, then I stopped and dived into Cybersecurity, later I felt like coding was really my thing, I am here to now blend the two! Wish me luck! I saved this video for later only after seeking through twice and I have a great conclusion.",1
I started doing the projects over on jupyter notebook and then got stuck at hangman as I have no clue about jsons or importing 'em. Just got done with getting VS code installed. Hoping to complete all of the projects & learning lots of new skills (including json file types & bunch of other things which I have no idea about). Thanks for the amazing free content freecodecamp.,1
Wow the logic of the hangman game is crazy. Great challange though going through it 1 by 1 hoping to finish end of May 🤞🏾🤞🏾,1
Thank YOu.,1
I don't know which is more awesome the 12 projects or kylie ying!! She is so cuteeee🥰,1
I've only watched the first 1 hour and I already know you're one of the brightest minds I've ever seen.,1
"nice lady , its a power for learning.",1
Thanks Kylie. Your awesome,1
Thanks! I learned a LOT! Some of these projects are just scratching the surface and its pointing me in the right direction!,1
Great,1
Best Fun Python Developer Ever!,1
"Thanks Kylie, this is very well done.",1
this is awesome,1
I first time thank somebody. You told us perfectly. thank you very very much,1
"Hi thanks for the tutorials. I found these fascinating, and also amazed at how simple some of the game mechanics are, but only if you have programming skills. I did find that you moved through quite a few different concepts and methods that I am completely new to and would love further details in these...particularly whilst going through tic tac toe ai / minesweeper / and sudoku. but it was still great fun to work through, and troubleshoot where I had gone wrong and finally get the programs working. (Might be helpful in future to show snapshots of the code for reference purposes) I will come back to this video again in future...hopefully will have better understanding on some of these concepts - and also come back to the last two concepts. I think that some of these exercises are for the Advanced beginner...if that is even a thing. Either way. Thanks for the video",1
Bro you're so cute.,1
This is an incredible gem! Thanks so much for making this video - I'll go through every single one of these,1
"1:31:19 Wow, free hands coding ...",1
"Kylie Ying, excellent job done. Thank you for contributing for community. Keep it up.",1
"Awesome content! Thanks for these projects, will be doing at least 1!!!",1
"Honestly, that is the least cringe dab I’ve seen. Ima watch the video!",1
"thank you  a lot, very usefull for me",1
"Hey Kylie Ying, u look so beautiful. And the content I'll go through it..",1
I love this girl :-*,1
You're cute,1
I have fallen in love with her,1
very great content. want stuff like this more!!!,1
"So hard first two projects give me confidence, after that it took all from me whatever i thought i knew",1
Thank you !! : ))),1
"thanks for show me all interesting projects, I learned new things, you are amazing.....",1

omg you are so cute !!!,1
Anyways you are beautiful !!!,1
Yay! I have subscribed your channel.,1
"Thank you so much, I learnt a lot - This is one of the top videos where a lot gets done in a small time!",1
"Hello Thank you for taking the time to do this series of videos, you are a great programmer, but need to improve your teaching skills, and this series of videos are not for beginners maybe medium level and more. just for example in the hangman game in the minute 29:05 you have user_input = input('type something:') print(user_input)  because you were testing the input, but then you change and explain the removing letter and continue in minute 30:45 the last part of the code is hangman() to call the function to play the game, but you didn't explain that, maybe take a pause a recap all the code people can notice the change, for me as a beginner or less, was hard to find!... Again thanks for your time !",1
Dabbing at the start of the video instantly merits a like,1
It was so cool. I really like your loveable attitude.,1
I loved this amazing video,1
6:48 she’s pretty and cool,1

i love you !,1
very good coding skills!,1
"no one: literally no one: free code camp: let me introduce you to a great programmer, with great content",1
perfect! absolutely perfect!,1
"Hey, the min max functions in ranges is really confusing (I know the gist of what's going on, but debugging is a pain), maybe just an if block as a guard (works for me whenever I get lost)... thanks for the tutorials! You're awesome (I actually made a minesweeper game! So cool!)",1
"Thanks for the tutorial, I was looking for building something so cool but also not that complicated. I was about to click away until I saw the Tic Tac Toe AI part in your description. I have made this. And now to challenge some friends. Have a great day. If you can make a simple chess AI tutorial it would be great. Anyway thanks for the AI tutorial.",1
Now I know. Its a good thing I didn't quit Pyyhon,1
"I love this so far! I've been doing projects, and I noticed a small error in your final code for the Tic Tac Toe game, in player.py where you say '\s turn. Input move (0-9): ' it should be 0-8 instead, since 9 in this case is invalid.",1
Thank you mem,1
I like this Ladie,1
"Hey Kylie, thanks a bunch for this! Really great, clear explanations. I'm using it with my students in small chunks and they love it!",1
This looks way easier than Java. I think I'm gonna learn this one next.,1
I tapped out after rock paper scissors haha. I did skip to the sudoku part and my head just hurt lol. Very clever girl and well presented though so I will be checking out her channel,1
Great job !!!,1
She is so cute,1

You are so funny. Thank you so much!! ^^,1
"wow, you are beautiful.",1
wow! what a way of asking to subscribe.,1
"Thanks for the inspiring ideas for projects and simple games. Easter Egg: You should already know, but In the video (the hangman part) you create the method 'get_valid_word()' without returning the 'word' with upper method called. I also looked in the repo and its fixed. I am following the video and sometimes comparing in the project gihub.",1
its ok. kinda rushes through.,1
"Obs #1: def get_valid_word(words):      word = random.choice(words)     while '-' in word or ' ' in word:          word = random.choice(words)              return palabra.upper()  I've changed: def get_valid_word(words):       word= random.choice(words) #here, you are selecting a word.  ok?      return word.upper()  Really, Thanks a lot for your examples.  Taking notes and studying.. Take care.  bYe.!",1

Thanks for the amazing free content!,1
really enjoyed and learnt a lot,1
"Business Opportunity in Ruvol  I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”    It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.”   The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.  HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?  I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0  BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!  It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.  You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.     Thanks and God bless!   RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL The Ruvol Inventor",1
Thanks for video,1

Great video again... Love your videos,1
You are awesome!,1
Sims lol. That's funny,1
Great video! Super nice explanation Just didn't like that hand writing  :/,1
My phone is just a smart phone 😀,1
Best ever explanation i have ever seen....... Good work Garry Sir.....,1
Mr. Gary pls change the background. The old background is good. Good video as always.,1
Great video 👍,1
Oh...It's nice Nice explanation,1
Good morning Professor !!! P.S. I recently watched the documentary AlphaGo. Its awesome,1

Thanks for helping in order to understand what is the actual difference!!!,1
Wow ..,1
Another great vid from Gary,1
Great comparison subscribed to your channel 👍,1
"I just got the One Plus 9 pro last night... I know everyone talks about the cases on both.. How the Samsung looks more modern ect, Yes the One Plus reminds me of my Samsung Plus 8,  but I don't know anyone that going to stop and talk to me about the design of my phone.  So ultimately it came down the the best phone for the dollar. That is why the One Plus 9 Pro wins for me and I have owned a Samsung cell phone for ever...  Great video btw..",1
save your $200,1
"Nice video. 1st time on your channel. I like your review style. However, $900 is anything but budget friendly. It’s still expensive, just not as much as the Samsung perhaps is better fitting way to class it.",1
"Good job, the one plus 9pro for me",1
"I picked up the S21 Ultra, and I love it!  Amazing cameras!",1
"Good video mate , but i gues i will get the 9pro 9 pro is 890€ in eu and the ultra is 1290€",1
"Got the Oneplus 9 Pro myself, absolutely love it, after three updates the camera has already drastically improved. Gotta love the warp charge too. Battery life is getting me through the day as well. 😊😊",1
It is always a sheer pleasure to watch Luke's videos.,1
Nice comparison,1
Switched from S9+ to the OnePlus 9 pro and damn boy this phone is a beast... Even the camera is super good I've got nothing to complain about... Loving the OP experience...,1
Samsung S21 Ultra is by far the best!,1
"I am a oneplus fan, i had the 1,3, 5t (currently using) and their oxygen OS was better than samsungs UI comparing it to the galaxy s3, that was the last galaxy for me I'm sure the is is way better now. Anyways with oneplus prices a lot of oneplus users might jump the wagon and go to samsung for better support and better specs.",1
Loving the new A-Roll set!,1
🍇🍇🍇 Samsung is the Best Yay 🍓🍓🍓,1
"Really nice phones, great video :)",1
Awesome! I personally feel Oneplus 9 pro is the best of all smartphones.,1
"soo, i really like python. Its cuz the syntax is simple and you can use the class keyword for grouping functions or actually creating instances of that class. But, what i like about C# for example (which is the case for many other languages too) is that you can give multiple constructors unlike in python. Lets say you have a screen class again. now, you could create it using the width and height. But if you buy a phone, often only the aspect ratio and "" numbers r given. soo, you could give it a Vector structor, or a number in inches and a string or tuple, representing an aspect ratio. No matter what you pass in, it creates successfully, without checking for a min amount and combinations of information being given or any funky crap like that.",1
Thank you so much! Can't tell you how much I appreciate this,1
"Awesome! Wonderful video, thank you :)",1
very good video,1
"I like your video, it is well explained, serious and easy to see.... my favorite OOP language is Ruby, because I think, as it says in its own definition, it is a truly fully OOP language, plus its syntax is just outstanding. Greetings from Mexico. =)",1
Encapsulation When data field is private You should create set and get method :) awesome video even though I’m one year old late to this.,1
"It might just be me, but I've found that the terminology used to teach OOP increases the confusion of learners. I might take things more literally than others, but when I see ""parent class / child class""  I think that the child class is subservient or less effective than the class it inherits from. So before I even start coding I view OOP as a hierarchy of classes and wonder why I should ever bother with writing classes if I can just use a few separate functions instead. Java's classB extends classA is the best terminology to use, I think.  The core complaint I have is a recent one: OOP only begins to make sense architecturally when you are operating at scale and have some understanding of WHY OOP was invented in the first place. If you don't know what problem it was invented to solve in software engineering, then you're limited in how much you can understand it. If you didn't have OOP and relied on functions interacting on data then eventually you'd stop scaling due to cognitive overhead or architectural limitations.  The best lesson I've found on OOP was a talk by one of Python's core developers, Raymond Hettinger. Raymond gives the background for WHY objects and classes exist in the first place. Link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8moWQ1561FY  OOP was invented because of problems with software engineering in the 1980s. After viewing his talk and understanding the problems coders had with scaling their apps while keeping them maintainable, it starts to make a lot more sense. OOP makes your programming language itself more scalable so you can easily manage the increasing complexity of your app, and if you are a newbie joining a team, if they use OOP it's a LOT easier to get up-to-speed adding code to their codebase.   After watching Raymond's talk, I view OOP as a gift from the coding nightmares those teams faced. We have much more sophisticated tooling and techniques to create very advanced apps in small teams. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the like were ONLY POSSIBLE DUE TO OOP  Before OOP, you used to have to read enormous books to understand all of the data and functions in a codebase, and then you spend months learning which functions could be used on what kinds of data. And if you used the wrong one you might introduce a bug and bring the system down. Type-checking helped somewhat but there are limitations. OOP helped fix this specific issue by introducing objects which could ONLY have certain operations performed on them. Then you start to notice functions have overlapping behaviours (i.e. add(a, b) and add_multiple(*nums) . From that origin, you can begin to see how inheritance emerges as a natural solution to that problem.   Anyway, HIGHLY recommend watching that link. It's absolute gold.",1
"OOP is almost 40 years old now.  Same basic concepts.  Good simple concise explanation in this vid!  The only thing I'd add is that this isn't limited to real world objects as you described in the beginning of the vid.  In fact, it is probably more useful and more widespread applied to conceptual objects.  Good stuff!",1
"Thank you Sam, I really appreciate your videos. 6:48 - I would love more explanation on that matter. I don't get things like:  Book a = new Audiobook(); Book b = a;  Animal animals [] = new Animal[2]; animals[0] = new Cat();  Audiobook a = new Book();   I don't even don't know how to look for that on Internet,. I don't expect to make a video on this, but, if you consider that this is a pattern that has a name and there are more like me in search of info about this, maybe you could approach it in one of your future videos. I hope I made myself understood, English is not my native language. Anyway, thank you for your great work!",1
crystal clear explanation,1
Best ever video on oop. My fav programing language is c#.,1

"Hi, I’ve taken the TOEFL once and the first time I only managed to get a 62. I was really expecting my TOEFL grades to be 90+ to 105, and I believe everyone else was expecting me to pass the minimum standard in order to proceed with my next course of action. I’m retaking the TOEFL in April 10th and I aim to score a 100+. I’ll try best this time and I hope you folks out there get your target score. Peace out and good luck.",1
"Haha, the vendor was really loud :D",1
nice tips which you have to us   thank you,1
Very helpful video u have made Thnk you soo much,1
Your tips were helpful . I scored 25/30 in reading,1
"Hi, I gave my TOEFL yesterday and your tips were so helpful! I got 30/30 in my reading section. Big thanks! My advice to anyone preparing for this section - please take the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th tips very seriously. The TOEFL reading being much less challenging than the reading comprehension of GRE can easily be done one paragraph at a time. Also you may think that reading being the first section, you won't face any disturbance but when people start their listening section 10-15 minutes before you, you can hear the passages from their headphones even if you have your headphones on. Plus this tip becomes more crucial when you are on the listening section and some people are on their speaking one which is what happened with me.",1
Really like your honest views! I am writing my TOEFL tomorrow,1
EXCELLENT ADVICE!!,1
"Thanks brother, these tips helped. Got 114/120 R 27 . Kudos to you 👍🏻😇",1
Great toefl videos.Thanks,1
Thank you for these tips! Will make sure not to start the test earlier than the other test takers :),1
"The last tip was a great help. I always doubt myself about focusing on the summary sentence on that question, you know, the one written in bold for every summary question. In my head, i think that all my answers should coincide with that passage though the answers might not necessarily be the meat or bulk of the whole passage",1
Great Tips mate.,1
"Thank you so much. I have been struggling with the summary questions.. I usually get only 2 right choices out of 3. But I liked your strategy, I'm gonna use it!",1
Totally true,1
"Hey! Your videos really helped me with TOEFL, especially the speaking section. You've given tips which are out of the box. Great work!",1
Thanks for your help! 😍,1
Thank u,1
You are really smart guy,1
"First of all, thanks for those crucial tips... But, I Couldn't find any link for the material in the description as you had mentioned.",1
Dude You can qualify for a scholarship Program by ETS for Indian students with high scores. You should definitely check that out. also great vid,1
Good honest advice,1
Thanks for your advices 😁,1
"Thank you so much Yash, this video is exactly what i wanted to know a day before TOEFL.",1

SOLVE one test passage,1
Thanks Dude. This video gave me good tips for my toefl test.,1
Awesome! thanks for your tips. One mistake is like nothing because your brilliant person. The best part is that one wrong answer gives you the valuable lesson indeed we learn from u as well. Not only one but the whole concept for the test.,1
You are so smart and handsome. Wish I could have a private tutorial from you. 😉,1

"You seem to be a very determined person. I agree with everything you say, except for the part when you say anyone could score a 120 on TOEFL in 7-15 days which is only limited to a variety of people proficient with English. I myself dedicated 6 months of been cocky and messed up my first try with the test. I’m retaking the test soon and I’ll do my best this time.",1
Dudeeee This guy is sexy lolllll,1
"Though I prepared for a little longer, I got 100 🔥 I thoroughly followed what you said here. Thank you so much ☺️",1
"Finally got my marks. Definitely listen to this guy’s tips, they work. I got great marks in toefl and I prepared for less than 5 days. I didn’t use the same resource as him, however, I wish I had. Watch notefull videos and also check out this guy’s videos on each section. Good luck to everyone doing toefl!",1

Thank you so much bro!!,1
"Amazing video brother. It would be really great if you could share some student profiles who got a masters and phd admits in CS from MIT, UCB, CMU  and if GRE isn't that a major contributing factor then what other aspects of our profile we should focus on. Thanks and keep up the great work.",1

Wow it really helped me 👀👀👀,1
Thanks for sharing the TOEFL Practice Test. Really useful.,1
"I can't believe i understand the conversation. I don't study English much, English isn't my first language, and nobody would teach me more about English. And usually, i just read novel and watch videos on Youtube, so I don't think it would help since i did it just for fun. Anyway thanks for all the material you've uploaded online. It helps me so much :D",1
Hi I just wanted to know the right answers so I'll know how good am I at English and great job 🤗,1

Thank you so much 😊,1
Some answers are so confusing...But the joyful smile at the end was sooo reliefing...Thanks a lot...,1
"I believe very much in the power of learning a language by listening. But, to be honest, we cannot stop there. Listening only and doing nothing more with this knowledge will give very disappointing results. We must use the language actively by speaking! Listen first, then speak as much and as often as you can!",1
love you!,1
really it is interesting . this is suitable  TOEFL listening practice... Thanks,1
Josh thank you,1
"Hello everyone.  First of all, thank you TST Prep for providing these practice listening questions.  Second, here is some advice if you are having trouble with the listening portion of the test:  I suggest you practice this with any English-speaking videos.  Listen to the video at 1.5 times speed.  It will be hard for you. Then immediately listen to it a second time at 1.75 times speed.  It will be very hard.  Then listen to it at 2.0 times speed.  Try your best-- maybe you will only be able to get a few words.  Finally, listen to it at 1.25 times the speed.  Suddenly it will seem very slow and you will be able to understand a lot of it--- but you are now actually listening to English 25% faster than normal!  Practice this on any English videos a half hour a day for two weeks.  You will be amazed at how much better you get! When you listen to the actual TOEFL at normal English speed it will seem so easy.  This trick works for any foreigh language, by the way. (I think the audio clips you use should be between 2 and 5 minutes long.  You want to be able to remember what you just heard.  My best guess is that longer videos will make this more difficult.)",1
Thank you very much sir.,1
I just learning 2 mouth and I have 3 true in 1 passage . I think so it's not bad. Thanks you so much 🥰.,1

Thanks. It helps me to teach TOEFL for my student,1
"Hey Josh, I really appreciate all your videos and this listening test is invaluable to me. However, I'd like to point out that there is a discrepancy between your video and downloaded material in answer choice A) of the third question of the first lecture and that maybe you could correct that. In the video, the answer is formulated as ""Linguistics major"" and in the material as ""Spanish major"". I was doing the test while watching your video, so I eliminated A) immediately because linguistics is not Spanish. Then I choose B) as the next best choice and made a mistake, but I would have chosen A) if it had been formulated as ""Spanish major"". Anyway, keep up the good work, you are the best Toefl teacher!",1
"Hi Josh. I did not know where to write my comment. I watched all your videos LOL Anyway, I took my test in September (it has been a while, I know), and I wanted to say THANK YOU!!. You helped me to build up my confidence, even though I was ssuuupeerr nervous and I thought I messed up in my Reading section, I did enough for what I needed. I wanted at least 100, but I had a 96.  You are amazing, your energy is contagious. Good luck",1
"Hey Josh! This is the most popular video so far, and I'm writing here so that many can see. I have recently gotten 114 on the TOEFL. You helped me a lot with the exam, and I am ever so grateful to you! Rarely do I meet such good people. Good luck to you!",1

"Hi, I gave my TOEFL yesterday after having studied for it in under a week using mostly free resources like this channel. I did both the listening tests from the channel - the one from 2019 and this one. Those and the listening tips video helped me get 30/30 in the TOEFL listening section. The material and level of questions was definitely more challenging than the actual TOEFL which prepared me well for it.  Thank you so much! :))",1
Thank you for the test.,1
This is great! Thanks a ton,1
Thank you sir! very content!!,1

thank you so much. This practice test is really helpful since I've done all the old toefl listening practises and couldn't find any new tests until this video. Taking the TOEFL test on this Saturday 8th of August.,1

Everything aside your eyes is attractive 🤩 hell after watching this video for the second time I get what you're saying at first I was looking at you and thinking wowwww God makes perfect things too,1
thanks for this amazing test,1
thanks u soooo much but i only have 226/230,1
"I heard and watched it and it's interesting listening practice. Thank you TST Prep , it makes me want to have more listening practice from now :)",1
"I have to accept that the test was very hard for me. It keeps remind me that I need practice a lot.  Thank you for your videos, are just amazing !",1
"Hi, I've greatly appreciated the help I got through TST prep and want to say thank you! I got a 29 on the listening part. I like to mention, that I did not take notes but used a different technique. I would repeat -in my head- a word or two of what was just said throughout the listening section. I continued to do this about everything that was said and then answered the questions quickly. I found, that in the listening section the questions and answers were straight forward and relatively easy. I was amazed at how great it worked for me. If you like to take notes, that's fine, however, for me, it felt that it took away from active listening. So I would recommend, if you are prepping for this test right now, try it once and see how you do. Thanks again to Josh MacPherson!",1
"hi sir , thanks for the video . In the real test do the questions automatically jump to next after few seconds  passes , as in this video where q2 -q3 jump automatically in some seconds Or like we listen to recording 1 and have a fixed like 2-3 min overall to complete he 5-6 ques . so the timer runs per question basis or for a whole set of recording . i hope you are getting my point",1
"I got super exhausted by going through this, but after finishing, he praised me a lot. So Im happy now. THX^_^",1
Thank u so much..it was helped me to improve my english,1

"My raw point = 20 and estimated score = 22 .... Bravo 👍 This is my very first listening  TOEFL test , I have ever taken .. I did at least 1 or 2 mistake's in each section except the one based on circadian rhythm as I am a medical student so I get that one more effectively as I thought so ...  Thanks TST prep 😍",1
23/28 .... M really disappointed... but I did 28/28 in my second attempt... thank you Josh... your every video is supportive...,1
"Just took a Toefl home edition! Reading and Listening was slightly easier, Writing and Speaking was more difficult than TST materials. It was way easier to concentrate since I could take the test at home. I don't think there is any downside to it. So take a home edition when it is still there!  The reason I'm writing is to say  thank you:) Thank you so much for your lectures. Your Emergency Toefl Course has helped me immensely. Without your Channel, I couldn't have gotten the score I wanted. Thank you again and wish  you all TST people the best!",1
Josh i'm glad you speak easily so that everybody can understand,1

"I have a question, if you don’t mind! I cannot understand the answer for #3 in passage 1, since usually in the States they have linguistics and also literature major apart in the Spanish major, but in the option 1 which says she is not linguistics major in this sentence, in this case, linguistics look like it refers to Linguistics department. If the answer were the option 1, it should’ve been Language not linguistics, I guess... And in the conversation the professor says the spanish department is strict for the rules that only spanish major could be allowed, could imply that also the department itself is in charge of the program as well. Thank you for uploading practice tests, it have helped me a lot.",1
Thank you 😗😙😙😙😙😘,1

Thank you for making these videos. Agree with most everyone else. Your calmness and demeanor is very appealing and much appreciated. Not to mention the valuable tips 😉,1
"Astute observations.  My final tip: some of you are night owl academics like me and the exam in your country may happen at 9 AM when you would be normally be asleep. If this is true then this is suicidal for your grades. Do the practice of 10 mock tests mentioned here exactly when the test in region might be happening in the day if possible. If you have jobs, at the very least make sure you are fully natural for months to be awake and active at that time of day. Good luck.",1
Wow great explanation sir i will surely follow your guidelines i want to score 330 plus i want to go Stanford University after scoring 330plus in gre,1

"Thank a lot mate! So I gave my GRE yesterday and got 326 with barely 15 days of preparation, while working in the government sector in India during this pandemic phase. Though I was a bit disappointed, because I should have scored more in Quant (considering my decent enough quant legacy) but it's okay. And yeah, I followed you and Greg Mat. Thanks once again.",1
Thank you Philip ..,1

Absolutely Fantastic Video,1
I love the no BS approach to just straight up showing what needs to be done to get a high score. People really tend to overcomplicate things when its really practice - fail - reflect - repeat for as long as needed. Thank you!,1
Good job!,1

"Great video , you deserve much more subs 😍",1
"Sir,  I think that a Solid Study Plan is necessary to get a good score on GRE. In my case, I randomly studied the topics and I would able to get 161 in Quant. And that was similar that I got in my several practice exams. I think it was my maximum and I could not cross that barrier despite hard efforts. My question is that whether it is possible to cross this maxima?",1
So important advices thank you,1

"Literally baffled by how well this has worked for me, especially the advice regarding reading the passage slowly and comprehending it as i progress. Took a 6 question test in RC right after this, applying every advice with the addition of POE (Process of Elimination), got a perfect 6 in about 8 minutes. Although they were medium difficulty questions, Iam gonna ride this wave to a 320+ GRE score. Highly appreciate what you are doing here, carefully dissecting each conspicuous problem and coming up with ingenuous solutions.",1

"Hello Phillip, Merry Christmas! I have found your RC videos of great help. Given RC as probably the most challenging and onerous part of the GRE exam especially for non-natives, would you please provide us with more RC videos? Reading GRE passsages and answer the questions online and DISCUSSING why some options are not correct is the one we, test takers, are eager to have. Thanks a million!",1

Thanks for this! It really helped me increase my accuracy. analyse,1
Great! Thank you.,1
"I took your advice on being excited to read and taking my time, summarizing each sentence, and boy i tell ya, i took a practice test and got every answer from one passage correct. It made me feel so good. Thanks so much! Going to continue to approach it in that way.",1
"Thank you,  this really helps!",1
thank you sir for youe effort. one request please make lengthy videos on vocabulary and comprehension ... like for an hour or two. i know it would take times. but its really helpful for us to sit back and hearing you.  it will help us to get hooked. thank you so much again.,1
"This is great advice for the LSAT as well! The RC section is notoriously difficult to improve in. In my experience, your advice, these understated fundamentals, can really take you far.  I tried various different methods to approach RC, and this method works by far the best for me.",1
"Great video! I use to get around 40-50% on my tuition tests as they were said to be at the level of year 11 and I am in year 8. After applying these tips it jumped to 70-80%. The tip where you read slowly is absolutely amazing, I would've never thought of it! Thank you, I'm definitely subscribing",1
"Slowest to read, Fastest to answer"" is exactly what I wanted. I got 9/11 questions correct. Thank you so much. Keep rocking",1
You are such a grounded beautiful soul 😍😍😍 Love love love your eyes 😌,1
This video never gets old for me. Am always getting back to it to boost myself before I do a reading passage. Still working on the same strategies for abstract passages. It's kinda hard for me to be interested in passages that revolve around very abstract jargon.,1
This is a well thought out video. Thank you!,1
That is great advise!  Thank you so much!  I am sharing your video with my daughter who has some brain damage from an accident and she needs a strategy to help her with a college entrance exam.,1
Your video is one of the most helpful that I have thus far encountered. Thank you very much. I am studying for the FL Teaching GK Exam (again).,1
"Hi The technique in which you suggested, helped me to score 7/20 questions in RC. Even though it sounds less number of correct questions. I usually used to get 2 questions correct out of 20. It has improved my score. While comparing with my previous mark, it has made a huge difference scale. Highly appreciate what you are doing here and carefully dissecting each question. Thanks, brother 😍 Regards from India.",1
Bro I really like the way you approach to solve Rc.It would really helpful if you do a full video only solving lot of RC question that would change our way of thinking.,1

This actually made me Lol. love it! I will apply these strategies in my exam tomorrow!! Thanks for a great and engaging video!,1
"Woo hoo! I score much higher in Verbal than on Quant in the GMAT, so I have not been spending so much time practicing verbal even though there are some more points I could score there. This is such a helpful perspective on absorbing information not just to take a test, but to be fully present and process all the lessons life has to give us. I practiced on two hard Reading Comprehension passages after watching this video, and got 5/6 correct-- and then understood why I got the one wrong (surprise: I rushed, even when I was trying to take my time!) Thanks for the really practical advice here.",1
Man! You are really helpful. Will give you a shout out on reddit! Thanks for the content!,1

"I have never been great at reading comprehension. After watching this and applying these strategies, I am doing a lot better now. Thank you for this video!",1
"Saw this video today , I was searching for something which can help me out to ace RCs in my exam (CLAT) it has more LSAT like composure . Spent good 20 minutes In understanding what you said . After that I attempted 10 RCs in a row and was perplexed to see how this worked out for me and time was also managed good . I took 32 minutes and I usually take this much or sometimes even more than that , but the thing  which made me amazed was accuracy and I was able to grasp every thing which passage was trying to say . Thankyou very much , a good tutor , a good  technique , follow religiously and you are gonna do good .  ""Slowest in room to read and fastest to answer ""....🔥",1

Thank you!! :) You gave me the required confidence.,1
It was awesome! Can you cover all the question types please!,1
It's absurd how well this works.,1
"Wow! This was an amazing learning video! When I had attempted an RC before I was about to start the prep, I scored a low 1-2 correct out of 5-6 but as you were guiding through while reading the RC it felt waaayyyyyy more EASIER than what I was doing! If you'll drop a few more of these RCs for us it would be really helpful. Overall video :- 10/10 :D",1
"When I am watching this video, you already have 544 who subscribed to your channel. Congratulations! I am usually good at reading comprehension, so I agree with you about your strategy. Your suggestions reminds me of another great teacher's teacher on setting up for LSAT logic game. When you take the time to understand /setting up, it saves you time and effort trying to answer your questions correctly.",1

"While it might not not be devoid of merits, I find myself in a curious state of not not appreciating the not unimpressive aspects of this content.",1

I can't deny that I didn't not enjoy watching this.,1

I didn't not love how this wasn't not impressive.,1

Run time 3:37:00 - I think we have to compile the model every time before we do a fit. Otherwise it just memorize the previous epochs and use it for next iterations. In this case I believe that 92% accuracy of 1 epochs is the same as the addition of previous epochs i.e 10+8+1 = 19 epochs,1

Thanks a lot for making it on youtube.ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘,1
"Great effort, thank you very much. Although if you don't mind a little feedback, I have to say you have a few mathematical mistakes. for example in the introduction and definition of vectors, matrices and tensors (I haven't finished the course yet, but in the first hour these were the only mistakes I noticed). Although this is somewhat common among the programmers and developers who do machine learning (being more practical and less theoretically on top of stuff), but I think if you are teaching something it should be correct. But otherwise this is a great course and I really thank you for your time and effort. Keep up the great work :)",1

"Hello Sir, First of all, You are amazing, I have learned soooo much from you.  Tomorrow is my TOEFL and I'm really confused about two things.  One is related to essay and other is to speaking.   I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do in those 15-20 seconds allotted for preparing? Since I've already taken the notes by that time while listening and reading. So am I supposed to write down the template that you taught? Or am I supposed to keep the template in mind itself?   I would really appreciate if you can guide me and response before my TOEFL.",1
Are the graders native speakers? I feel like they are not.,1

"Your tips are somewhat broad. My english is quite decent, but I am not able to organize my ideas in such a short time. Can you share tips on what when and how to write down notes? just how you did it, specifically please?",1
The TOEFL speaking section is so easy or everyone who a little bit knows about English speaking can get the maximum score on it? I am wondering how a person like you can get it?,1
"Hello! I want to ask what I can do If I donâ€™t understand the listening recordings in the speaking section? I mean my speaking ability is more powerful than my listening skill. Sometimes I canÂ´t understand the reasons which is given in the listening section. Therefore, I can not express myself because of the listening recording. 18/30 will be enough for me. What do you offer me? Thank you",1
"Thank u for the video, I couldn't find the link of TST prep, can you write it again plz",1
"Hey, thank you very much for your videos, they are great! If I buy the Practive Online Speaking Series, can I practice with it more than once? Thanks!",1
"Hello, I just got my toefl scores 108/120(R-25, L-26, S-29, W-28). My speaking section went extremely well, thanks to your amazing insightful videos, but considering my overall score do I need to retake the test or these scores are good enough?",1
"Hi Josh, I heard that itâ€™s better if you donâ€™t repeat words within a speaking questionâ€™s answer can I repeat the same words for different speaking questionsâ€™ answers? For example in question 2 (campus announcement) and question 3 (integrated lecture) use STATES in both: â€œThe campus announcement states...â€ and â€œThe lecture states that...â€Would it affect my score?",1
"Hey Josh @TST Prep , where can I find free speaking questions for practice?",1
"Hello, is whole speaking part reviewed by one person from ETS or are different tasks reviewed by different experts?  I am asking that because i think about using templates, If same person judge us it will be better to use different words every time,  i guess.",1
Hey josh! I took my TOEFL exam the other week and I am really disappointed when I got my speaking score. I got 25 but the specific score that is required for us is 26. I did great in other areas though. I am going to take it again next week. I am practicing & watching your videos again. I hope I can score 26+ on speaking. ðŸ¤žðŸ¼ðŸ™ðŸ¼,1
Wish me luck ...........I have my TOEFL tomorrow,1
My exam is in 2 days. I'm so nervous  about the speaking section. Wish me luck,1
Hi Josh! You're a gem. I got my scores today. I scored a 30 in my Speaking and all I had done was watched your videos for a week. Please keep up the amazing work you're doing! Love from India.,1
My test is Tomorrow wish me luck,1
"Hey Josh! This question maybe silly but I really dont know so I have to ask: When I buy the Speaking Series Product, can I make the simulation as many times as I want? Or I just have one chance?  Couldnt find this information on their website... Thank you in advance for your answer, and also for the amazing videos! My test is in 3 weeks and I am super nervous, but these videos are helping a lot!!",1
"Hi, please I need the link to download the pdf.",1
It would be super cool if they could inform us in the end of the test about our speaking grade by using this software like they do in writing and listening,1
Thank you for other amazing class Josh! Hopefully you and TST will bring more practice tests to us during this quarentine.,1
Hi please I want to be part of the live screen how can I join I am from Ghana .,1
"Hiii , please upload a video explaining the reading section ðŸ™ðŸ¼ (for me itâ€™s the hardest section)",1
This is so good. But I have a questionâ€”is it okay to use â€œyouâ€ in task 1 ? Thanks for the reply.,1
"Thanks a lot for this video, Josh. I didn't really get it, is that software for one-time evaluation or for multi-time practice?",1
Nice job dear tutor!Would you clarify how we can speed up our speech like an American native speaker?,1
"Hey Josh! I hope you get this message. I just want to thank you for these amazing videos. I cant tell you how helpful they were for me. I am from Pakistan and I recently gave my TOEFL exam, scoring 30/30 in the speaking section ONLY after two weeks of practice. You're doing a wonderful job! Love from Pakistan! ðŸ’•",1
"Thank you so much ,its agood information to learn it i apreciate for you ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹",1
Hey Josh!....if asked to speak about the teacher you admire need I necessarily speak about a subject teacher or anyone who taught me about something valuable,1
"Hello Josh, thank you for your videos. I have just found out about your channel. Is it ok if I use your videos on our website?",1
Is it absolutely necessary to provide a personal example? I usually answer these questions rhetorically because I don't have any work experience. I know I can make stuff up but I find it way easier to say what I want to do and how I would feel if for example I spent my whole life at one job..,1
"Hey Josh, i wonder if the vocab in Toefl is academic like in Ielts?",1
I donâ€™t understand why people click on dislike button. He does nothing but helping us. Thank you so much for your effort Josh ðŸ™ðŸ» You are the bestðŸ‘ðŸ» I really appreciate what you doðŸŒ¿,1
"45 seconds is toughðŸ˜‚, I'm such a great speaker that I'll keep talking about something for 5-10min easily without any knowledge ðŸ˜†, let's see where I end up though, Targeting a perfect 120 in TOEFL that's less than 2 weeks again...Will update it later.",1
"Hey Josh, your videos are amazing, really helpful, and interesting to me. Have one question for you. Are the questions in the Speaking part visible during my answering or not? If no, are they at least visible during the preparation time?",1
Hey! Just wanted to thank you. My score significantly improved after watching your videos. My speaking score shot up from 22 to 30 in two weeks!! You gave some amazing tips on speaking. I wish I had watched this video before the first time I took TOEFL!,1
"I tend to smile a lot and use much gestures while speaking, is it okay to do so?? Or is it a disadvantage for me??",1
"4:25 , in fact, it is the most challenging part of the video.",1
"Hi, I am very grateful to you for these videos. I started my speaking preparation just a couple of days before the exam and scored 26 while my score on a previous IELTS was just 6.5. You are a life saver ðŸ˜˜",1
"Hey Josh, thank you so much for all your videos. I've been using them for my toefl preparation. And today i finally take the exam! Wish me luck! ðŸ€",1
Your videos are really helpful to achieve my desired score...Thank you ðŸ™,1
"And here I am, unable to stop talking after my time is over :)",1
"Hello Sir, Thank you very much for making such quality study material free for students like me. I prepared for TOEFL  for a week and followed your tips dedicatedly. I scored 107 (R 26 L26 S 27 W 28). Regards and Love from India ðŸ˜Š",1
Hi teacher i love your teaching way i have a question for you my question is are you teaching american or british english?,1
"Thank you for these awesome videos. I used your channel for listening and partly for speaking. Glad to say I had 25 in listening, 28 in speaking. Overall, 110. Thanks a bunchðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
"Hello, I can give one reason and can develop it very well.   I don't come up with two reasons for it in 15 seconds, is it ok to give only one reason?",1
"Hello, thanks a lot for your helpful videos. I have a question. Is it fine to use just one reason with its example in this question? Because I found problems in time when giving two reasons with their examples. Thanks again",1
This channel helped me so much in my preparation. Used all the speaking templates as it is and scored a 27. I am so glad I found this. Thank you so much TST prep and Josh â¤ï¸,1
"This was really helpful and boosted up my confidence, I'll be giving my test day after tomorrow. Wish me luck.",1
I usually get through like 4 or more reasons and still have time left over and then start stuttering. I really need to speak slower.,1
"Haha! I actually paused, and tried my answer. I struggled to add the second reason. Itâ€™s too short time to add the second reason. How much will it affect my score if I stick to one detail reason?",1
"Iâ€™ve just passed the TOEFL exam today and was pretty surprised by the questions Iâ€™ve been asked. When I was preparing my exam, I didnâ€™t find so much content to practice and it seemed like all the tests had the same questions â€œonline classes or traditional onesâ€, â€œwhich one between family or friends have the most influence on young peopleâ€... And today, for Q1 of Speaking part, I got asked something like â€œWe should force companies to give a small part of their profit to organizations supporting people and entities they operate with. Agree or disagree?â€. How could I have given my opinion from my â€œown experienceâ€ with such a question? And are there â€œmore difficultâ€ sessions than others ones?",1
do you think it is useful to take notes in your mother tongue?,1
"This is an excellent video!!! It is very useful and it has many, many awesome informations that can also help everyone to have their speech better and expand it much more! Thanks for this video! You helped a lot!! ðŸ’ªðŸ‘â¤ðŸ‘â¤ðŸ‘",1
"This video help me lot ! But I still have a little problem. If l agree and disagree both options that gave by the question, may I discuss both ?   Thanks lot!",1
Is it allowed to not really decide between the options but to talk about the benefits of both? Thank you very much :),1
I actually stopped and video and responded to first question and  if could I would be speaking for minutes xD adding anegdots and expressing opinions xD,1
"Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I watched your YouTube videos while studying for the TOEFL exam, and I found them so incredibly helpful. I just got my score and was happy with it, and I wanted to say thank you for the help that you providedâ˜ºï¸",1
Thanks for a video with wonderful tips! Iâ€™m just curious whether I really have to say that much for 45seconds? I usually thought 6sentences are enough unless each one is too short.,1
Did this test yesterday! R30 L29 and the rest to be determined. Thanks for the help!,1
This is exactly what Iâ€™d been looking for! I love how you talk patiently:),1
"Hi thank you for sharing such a great strategy. While I was watching your tutoring I wondered if its necessary that second reason has to be related with the first reason. Because I am used to practicing giving two separate and independent responses instead of two being correlated, how do you think?",1
"7:06 is funny since I always try to actually avoid saying ""you know",1
"why does his voice sound familiar to me, oh yes his voice sounds like Ryan Reynolds.  Thank you.  It's a great video.",1
"To me, I definitely prefer to switch jobs every five years. it's a no-brainer! And I feel that way for a couple of reasons. First of all, learning new skills. For example, I worked a part-time job in a fast food restaurant for about seven months and I learned the communication skills with customers when I was a cashier. Moreover, I was bringing change from nearby banks. By the same token, making friendships. For instance, working at different jobs gives the you chance to make a whole lot of friendships that will last throughout your life. In a nutshell, working at various jobs is the best.",1
"Can we get questions like "" Describe a situation/experience when your friend helped you""  in the independent speaking question? Please reply soon as I have an exam coming up.",1
"Hi buddy, it's quite interesting that you're using natural language. There's no academic language proof of that is the use informal expressions like wanna, gonna, kind of, you know, etc.  I work all days for hours with a number of customers of Google and that's exactly how we sound all days. My big question is pretty much regarding the fact that we need to be formal and discuss academic questions in a test. Let's say your career prospects, short and long term objectives. Imagine we're talking with the ambassador of the UK and we have to convince him with our fully professional answers. Share your comments about this last point of mine.",1
"Should I talk about people or about me? Because in the practice one of my reasons were ""people change their interests",1
I can't say how much good this videoðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜Ž,1
"I scored 108 omg ðŸ˜­ I can't believe it, I'm so happy (R 28 L27 S25 W28)Thnak you so much, I am so grateful!!",1
Thank you... please if you can post new examples for all questions in the speaking section,1
"One question. The 45 seconds of the speaking, is it like u have to speak for at least 45 seconds or u have to sum up everything in 45 seconds",1
"HI Josh,I am watching your videos Which are very useful  and giving me confidence to take my tofel Ibt  test,But I Have one question for you . Q:When they ask any opinion or Agree/disagree Questions, If  I am not totally on one side like I have one positive example and one negative example Can I Continue with that positive or negative examples to answer that question? Or Do I need to find similar examples?  Can you please help with this? Thanks in advance",1
"Josh, is it mandatory to provide a personal example? When I try to do so, I struggle trying to find one that suits the question... Would I be penalized if I just point out two reasons? It seems easier to me.Thank you for your videos!",1
"I watched all of his videos and used these templates i got 27 on speaking, practiced for 4 days. And i am pretty bad at speaking. I want to thank you, JoshðŸ˜",1
"four years ago I scored 500 points in Toefl itp, for the master's degree I need to score 87 in toefl ibt. I have improved a lot since the first time.ðŸ˜€ I watch videos from youtube and I notice that the videos are very similar to the toefl itp but today I tried the practice test of the official website and for me it was much harder than I expected.ðŸ˜” I need tips.",1
THANK YOU! i just received my scores and i got 27 in the speaking ðŸ˜,1
"Hey Josh, thank you very much for your videos! I would appreciate if you could give me advice, considering that i did my TOEFL prep test. Iâ€™ve got 23 on speaking and the main argument for  not getting more points was â€œthe lack of detailsâ€. Delivery, language and topic development were good in all parts od speaking , but ,,missing detailsâ€ were prob in all parts as well. Any advice for improving this particular issue would be very useful, my exam is in 5 days :)) thanks in advance!",1
"If I chosed my prefer but then I say that I agree about another choice, what do you think? For example I'd say... I definitely think that keeping an unique job it's good in order to get more knowledge in that specific field. Although, having differents jobs could leads wide experience and safety to get differents jobs as the times passes... By the way, you're a genius, I'm copying your gestures and way to express.",1
"Iâ€™ve been practicing this question with 3 reasons, cause our TOEFL preparation teacher told us so.. what do you think is better? :) Thanks!",1
"Hi, I just wanted to ask if or personal examples have to be real? because I'm 17 and if I have a question on work or stuff like that I would not have personal experience. Thanks!",1
Why are you always saying so. is it good?,1
1:05 that sound effect scared the shit out of me.,1
"hi, where i can find the test of toefl, i wanna to test my self,  thanks teacher",1
I need a partner for speaking section. Is there anyone available? My whatsapp number is +51951695982.,1
I appreciate all the things you elaborated on here! Thatâ€™s great. I liked your transitional words and variety of questions which we can encounter (like personal choice/triple choice etc),1
"The video was really awesome. I loved the way you describe the naturality of speaking.About the free test you had shared, where can I get the audios ??",1
"Please, upload this template as a PDF <3",1
i love ur videos .. thank u so much .. plz put more videos .. ðŸ™ðŸ»,1
Thanks for the speaking suggestions and templates I got a 28 in TOEFL speaking though English is not my mother tongue and I donâ€™t speak English on a regular basis THANKS A LOT,1
"â€œDonâ€™t compare yourself to meâ€ - I kind of liked it, superb.",1
"Hi. Is it important to elaborate on the topic with a personal example/anecdote? In the question discussed in the video, I don't know what example to give because I'm a university student and I haven't worked before. So could I elaborate the reason more instead of giving a personal example?",1
My problem is that when i think of the words in my head it sounds very good but when i try to speak it my tongue goes haywire,1
Having my test on Saturday pray for me guysðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ˜£,1
One of the best teacher. Please upload other videos as soon as possible.Thanks,1

"I really loved this video, it was really helpful and it made my speaking for independent task much easier. I just want to ask what's the name of the soundtrack at the end of every video, because I enjoy listening to it but can't find it on youtube.",1
Thanks for the valuable content ! Keep it up man. I was wondering if you could help me with my question. What happens if someone doesn't present an example in question one? How much it will affect the score?,1
"One more question, in case of reading section can I read one paragraph of a passage and answer the relevant question?  Or will I have to read the entire passage first? I find the former helpful.",1

Because as a costumer, you have to buy a whole set of cartridge even though you cannot use its whole capacity. For example, for Susan, to calculate the print cost if using Zero, you should at least buy 1 Zero Toner set (which capacity is 11,000 pages) for Susan 2 yearsâ€™ print (7,800 pages =2*52*5*15), which cost $370 instead of $262.36 (=370/11,000*7,800). hope get your reply.",1

"Business Opportunity in Ruvol  I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it â€œRUVOL.â€    It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the â€œNumber One Board Game in the World.â€   The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become â€œmemorizable.â€  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents â€œblindfolded.â€  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called â€œFischer Random Chess,â€ where the starting position of the pieces is â€œrandomizedâ€ to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where â€œevery gameâ€ has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.  HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?  I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0  BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!  It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.  You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.     Thanks and God bless!   RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL The Ruvol Inventor",1

"In simple words Tesla's autopilot is an example for machine learning and all the voice assistants like Google, Cortana, Alexa ,Siri etc etc are examples of AI.",1
to make computers aware of thare users in much the same way a human becomes aware. artificially aware of things sounds and people around sounds great. the fact we are allready using desktop pcs with more tflops of compute performance than whats depicted as what data from star trek has yet recognition of things people and sounds around are still not even compairable to an ape never mind a human. so whats called a neural net is to make a chip like a gpu that has over 4000 stream processors and 20-25 tflops of compute power and rearrange the physical layout of the parallel processing cores so its no longer in a grid pattern to make something that works better not faster becouse raw computer power is not cutting it with even basic recognition of things sounds and people. just think intel is going to make cpus this year that have more horsepower than data from star trek and gpu makers have been making parallel processors with that kind of power since 2012 and none of that is cutting it.,1

"I could not decide, which one I would take, since I like One UI and Oxygen OS the same!",1
In an ideal world the OP 9 Pro has the cameras on the S21 Ultra or the iPhone 12 Pro Max ðŸ˜­,1
The Galaxy 21 Ultra got a big boost in battery life after a post launch patch. It is very likely that the 9 Pro will see such a patch.,1
Correction: It does have ip68 certification. Oneplus 9 does not have it but its still made with same materials just that they didnt pay for certification so it could be cheaper,1
I am done with samsung phones. My last 2 samsung phones were flagship phones and I had screen burn on both within 2-3 months. I watched few reviews of Plus 9 pro and none of them were stellar because most of them were before software updates but one of them has shown me enough to decide to go and buy it yesterday. To me it is a great phone. Samsung might get me back when their screens stop burning out. Untill then I will look into competition just not Iphone because I just don't like Ios.,1
"Oneplus wins in terms of the overall package. Camera is very good but not excellent battery is good but not excellent, ergonomics, software, updates, clean UI 65w charger in the box. As an overall package it checks all of the boxes",1
"Had the choice for both and went for the op 9 pro it beats the Samsung in important areas, both good phones though.",1
"Dxo mark be like: ""One plus 9 pro takes new crown at top spot for mobile photograaaappphhyyy!! "". Yeah ok dxo mark. Bunch of dumbasses.",1
"Wife has 21U and I have 9 Pro. Samsung has vastly better zoom and selfie cams. Main cams are pretty comparable. OP wide angle is a bit better. Actually using the OP9 is so much smoother and less janky than the Samsung which is loaded with mostly gimmicky ""features"".",1
"Who else love ""Samsung""?",1
Keep in mind if you're from Europe and you decide to go with Samsung you'll get the worse Exynos SOC over the Qualcomm which if you're looking for the best performance and battery life then the OnePlus 9 Pro would be the better bet.,1
Oneplus is better,1
Samsung wins no cap. Remember you can only lie to others but not yourself.Deep down you know galaxy 21ultra is a better phone overall ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,1

A method started with Uppercase don't follow Java conventions. A getter used to not ""get"" but ""print"" doesn't follow ""naming"" best practices. An object using a setter method which allows external object to change the internal state of the target object is a bad practice for encapsulation.  Anyway, I hope this video can help people who is starting in software development to understand the beauty of OOP.",1
Nice clip. I am new to Java and programming. What is the IDE you are using in this YouTube clip? Would like to preproduce your examples the same exact way,1
The example in this video about encapsulation is like abstraction.  Here is my view on the differences of encapsulation and abstraction:  Encapsulation is grouping similar/related elements (properties/methods) into an object. Abstraction is hiding the complexity and details of an object and showing only what is essential.,1
"my favorite oop language is java, idk why but i LOVE the  verbosity of it, i could review java code ALL DAY it is just so nice to look at for me lol especially with the intellij one dark theme",1

How much time we  want for the preparation for toefl,1
For me the greatest threat in the TOEFL is the length of the test,1
"Hi, Iâ€™ve taken the TOEFL once and the first time I only managed to get a 62. I was really expecting my TOEFL grades to be 90+ to 105, and I believe everyone else was expecting me to pass the minimum standard in order to proceed with my next course of action. Iâ€™m retaking the TOEFL in April 10th and I aim to score a 100+. Iâ€™ll try best this time and I hope you folks out there get your target score. Peace out and good luck.",1

I agree with everything you say, except for the part when you say anyone could score a 120 on TOEFL in 7-15 days which is only limited to a variety of people proficient with English.

Not too bad ..lol  ive prepared Ielts for 1 month and got 8.5 in listening ,  was just currious abt the Toefl listening test , did it for fun . but i feel its a little harder than ielts because you cant read the questions in advance and you have to concentrate on each and every sentence .....",1

"I believe I get everything they are saying, but it's like being in a real Science Class, having to take notes fast... But nothing stays on my head haha. I don't like Geology. It's great for practicing though",1
Thanks! Do the questions come in sets of two and you can't go back to change previous answers or are all the questions available all the way throughout the listening section?,1
Does the  Toefl listening part  have sometime strong sentences during the full lecture?  Because there are many toefl listening practises on YT and some have strong sentence and word during the whole lecture.,1
This listening was too easy!,1
I noticed something if you are an engineering/science student or professional you have some advantages taking this exam. Those audios were pretty easy to understand to me because I learned those theories in college and they like to use this kind of topics that is not common to many major. I just wanted to point that out.,1
Is it possible to come across the listening tests as number 3?,1

"Hello, I really appreciate the content but,  Lecture 1, question 2:  We both agree that answer C is correct. But when it comes to ""Guatemala is the most relevant place for me, it would perfect for me to go there and do some research about my ideas...""  You list b.) ""Because she has already studied about it...""  What does it even refer to? I suppose it refers to ""cost-effective"" farming, in which case there is effectively no semantic difference between a.) and b.). Therefore, besides c.), both a.) and b.) qualify as correct answers since both say the same thing.",1
"Hi Josh! I got a question about passage #5 question 2.

"Averagely, I answered 2 questions wrongly in each section of this test. I need to listen more carefully and read the instruction better. Need to work harder to fix this. Btw, for question passage 4, question number 4, I kinda confused with reading part technique because it used 'most' word. The audio clearly stated she is the only one who did not understand the assignment, other students did well, so I hesitate to answer C because im not sure if 'most' there represents the rest of the students except her. Silly me! huhuhu",1
But thank u so much T . i'm really thankful.ðŸ˜Š,1
which one is easier toefl or ielts ?,1
Passage 5 Question 6 Kindly justify why answer cannot be option B.,1

May you be blessed immensely! May all your problems resolve themselves. Teaching is a noble task and you are doing it so well. Thanks for this amazing video!,1
It assets more of your other skills than the language knowledge.,1
I like to practice this listening in my hp but why the letter is very small in the screen  not like the others,1
"I appreciate the video Josh. However, I think itÂ´s very unrealistic and most of the question choices are extremely similar (The Toefl does not try to do this very often). Otherwise, all the other videos that you make are top-notch :)",1
"Excuse me, why do some questions have multiple answers?",1
"First thank you for your help! However, I have a doubt on the last question. It doesn't say that is naturally so answer C is not the best one as answer B is. Could you explain me that one please?",1
It was my first time. I scored 20/28. Is it good?,1
"hi, can someone explain me why in the speaking 2, question 4, the answer is b? The thing that I don't understand is that it asks about which theory is most likely true, and the giant impact one is a hypothesis not a theory. So I put C as the answer",1
"So, is the listening test like this? You first listen to the audio and then answer questions? That doesnâ€™t seem fair.",1
I hope they value my finger Up!,1
"Hello teacher :) thank you for this helpful video! I just have one question. I registered to the site to get the answers, and it informed me that mail with a ling for download will be sent to me, but i have not received such mail for 12 hours :) can you check on that please?:) thank you",1

"Where is the answer key pls, I need to grade my test",1
"I have a question, if you donâ€™t mind! I cannot understand the answer for #3 in passage 1, since usually in the States they have linguistics and also literature major apart in the Spanish major, but in the option 1 which says she is not linguistics major in this sentence, in this case, linguistics look like it refers to Linguistics department. If the answer were the option 1, it shouldâ€™ve been Language not linguistics, I guess... And in the conversation the professor says the spanish department is strict for the rules that only spanish major could be allowed, could imply that also the department itself is in charge of the program as well. Thank you for uploading practice tests, it have helped me a lot.",1

"Question:  is there anyway to understand the viewpoint of the question writers? I often find that I get stumped by subtle differences between the text and the questions.  For example, the passage said that there were â€œfew successful attemptsâ€ to do something, and the correct response claimed there was a â€œfailureâ€ to do that thing.  Is this deliberate?  To interpret less black and white?  If I excel in math, these make me crazy.",1

"ETS, the ‘company’ that administers and own the GRE earned  $1,609,201,000 dollars in revenue in 2016.  “”ETS has grown into a  for-profit institution trading on its nonprofit status to create a  monopoly”” (read the New York Times and Business Week articles for more alarming revelations). Interesting how 'self-proclaimed' people don't think about how they are being taken advantage of or how colleges and universities are enabling the abusers. It's a tragic scam.",-1

"Practise, practise, practise, I couldn't agree more! All the tips and strategies that I learnt in my first attempt were useless (sometimes even detrimental, instead of using a strategy, I thought of that strategy during the test, which wasted time 😤). On the second attempt, where I finally got a 330+, it all boiled down to an efficient and well conducted practise.",-1

"Why is 3a in the first block correct? A linguistic major can refer to any language, but it is clearly stated that she probably isn't allowed to go because the Spanish department is in charge of this decision. I am an English linguistic major but I still wouldn't be allowed to go to Guatemala because I don't have any Spanish classes...based on this, 3a (she is not a linguistic major) is too vague to be the right answer in my opinion. Can someone explain?  I also find that 3 a and c in the third block could be both correct. People often ask questions by including the answer in order to a) confirm that they understood the task and b) to make the professor repeat his expectations again so that the person asking can be a 100% sure that what she way saying was right. I really struggle with those kind of questions because to me it says nothing about your English skills but rather tests your ability to interpret these questions in the same way TOEFL does. I asked a Native speaker and he got these two questions wrong, but speaks English perfectly...",-1
